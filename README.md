- This is a MERN stack project meaning it utilizes MongoDB, Express, Redux and Node.js to provide fullstack deployment.

# Technologies Used:
* React
* Redux
* MongoDB
* Express.js
* Node.js
* React-router-dom
* React-toastify
* dotenv
* CSS3
* Git
* GitHub
* JavaScript
* React-Icons
* Axios
* react-modal

# Approach:
I undertook this project to learn the MERN stack as well as gain a better grasp of backend development, databases and state containers. The goal was to create a user interface where customers can log complaints with customer service and communicate with service officers.

I hope to add a staff interface some day but would prefer to focus on original projects for now!
Although this project was very educational, there is not a lot of room to expand on the layout taught in [React Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/) on Udemy.com.
